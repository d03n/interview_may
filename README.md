In real-world development, Developer are not limited to using only what they already know. It‚Äôs perfectly acceptable‚Äîand expected‚Äîto reference resources like Stack Overflow, ChatGPT, MDN, or official documentation.

You are encouraged to use any tools or references necessary to complete these exercises, as long as you take the time to understand what you're implementing. The goal is to learn, think critically, and build with understanding‚Äînot just to copy and paste.


## Exercise 1 - Fix the Likes Counter
To fix the likes counter so that it updates correctly when the button is clicked. Specifically:
When the user clicks the button, the likes count should increase by 1 if the button changes to "üëç" (like).
When the user clicks the button again, the likes count should decrease by 1 if the button changes to "üëé" (unlike).


## Exercise 2 - Implement Debounce for API Calls
To optimize the API calls so that the fakeApi function is not called on every keystroke.
Instead, implement a debounce mechanism to delay the API call until the user has stopped typing for a short period (e.g., 500ms).


## Exercise 3 - Fix Total Price Calculation
To fix the Total component so that the total price updates correctly whenever a new item is added to the shopping cart.


## Exercise 4 - Infinite Scrolling with Pok√©mon API
Build a Pok√©mon listing page using the [Pok√©mon API](https://pokeapi.co/).
- Fetch and display 20 Pok√©mon at a time.
- As the user scrolls to the bottom, automatically fetch and display the next batch of 20.
- Continue loading in this fashion until all Pok√©mon are displayed.
- Ensure smooth user experience with lazy loading or infinite scroll techniques.

  - If they match, remove them from the board.
  - If not, flip them back after a short delay.
- The board should never have more than two cards flipped at the same time.
